# JenTex

JenTex is a simple native latex editor that I am making for my own use for taking notes in class. <br>
My goal is to have a super simple, lightweight app for latex editing that listens to vim commands, <br>
and also has a live preview mode so you can see your output document live as you are editing. <br>

1. `git clone ` <br>
2. `virtualenv venv` <br>
3. `source venv/bin/activate` <br>
4. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` <br>
5. `python3 main.py` <br>
